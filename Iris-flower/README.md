# this project uses the popular iris data set to predict the flower types.
most existing examples only show how to use the prediction models without
showing how to deploy the model to server.
This project goes one step further: we build the model using existing data first,
then generate the trained model. The model could be placed in any server.
The server application could load this model and generate a web application.
The end user could use sliding bar to input the data and the system will do the prediction
using the trained model.
