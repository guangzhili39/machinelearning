Over the course of my working life I have had the opportunity to use many 
programming concepts and technologies to do countless things. Some of these 
things involve relatively low value fruits of my labor, such as automating the 
error prone or mundane like report generation, task automation, and general 
data reformatting. Others have been much more valuable, such as developing 
data products, web applications, and data analysis and 
processing pipelines. 

One thing that is notable about nearly all of these projects is the need to 
simply open a file, parse its contents, and do something with it.
